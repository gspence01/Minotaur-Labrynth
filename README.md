# Minotaur: The Labrynth
## About:
>"Let the people of Athens this year draw lots for only six young men, instead of seven," said he, "I will myself be the seventh; and let the Minotaur devour me if he can!"<br /><br /> - Nathaniel Hawthorne, Tanglewood Tales

Thousands of years ago, outside of your town, lived a Minotaur blinded by an unqenchable, raging curse. He was locked inside an impenatrable dungeon, locked within the depths of the dark, lost abyss. It is your job, as Thesius, to hunt down this accursed monster and end the bloody violence forced upon your small town. Will you stop this curse, or be caught within the maze of the Labrynth?

### How to play
This is a simple game similar to PacMan. Use the arrow keys to navigate your character through the maze and pick up items to kill the Minotaur!

## The Assets:
I drew all these assets myself with a [free MS Paint copy](https://jspaint.app/). Ideally, I'd love to use better graphics, but i only have a week for this short lil' project. 
## Bugs and unfinished functionalities I'll fix (eventually):
